### General Guidelines

### General Guidelines

- Use React 19 functional components with TypeScript 5 for all UI elements.
- Use TSX for both static layouts and interactive components to maintain consistency.
- Implement Shadcn/ui components for accessible, high-quality UI primitives.
- Strictly type all component props and API responses using TypeScript interfaces or types.

### Guidelines for Styling

#### Tailwind

- Use the @theme block in CSS for customizing the design system (replaces tailwind.config.js).
- Utilize CSS variables directly for theme values and color tokens.
- Use the cn() utility (tailwind-merge + clsx) for conditional classes and Shadcn/ui component overrides.
- Use arbitrary values with square brackets (e.g., w-[123px]) for precise one-off designs
- Implement the Tailwind configuration file for customizing theme, plugins, and variants
- Implement dark mode with the dark: variant
- Use responsive variants (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) for adaptive designs
- Leverage state variants (hover:, focus:, active:, etc.) for interactive elements

### Guidelines for Accessibility

#### ARIA Best Practices

- Use ARIA landmarks to identify regions of the page (main, navigation, search, etc.)
- Apply appropriate ARIA roles to custom interface elements that lack semantic HTML equivalents
- Set aria-expanded and aria-controls for expandable content like accordions and dropdowns
- Use aria-live regions with appropriate politeness settings for dynamic content updates
- Implement aria-hidden to hide decorative or duplicative content from screen readers
- Apply aria-label or aria-labelledby for elements without visible text labels
- Use aria-describedby to associate descriptive text with form inputs or complex elements
- Implement aria-current for indicating the current item in a set, navigation, or process
- Avoid redundant ARIA that duplicates the semantics of native HTML elements

### Guidelines for Styling

#### Tailwind & Shadcn/ui

- Use the @layer directive to organize styles into components, utilities, and base layers
- Use arbitrary values with square brackets (e.g., w-[123px]) for precise one-off designs
- Implement the Tailwind configuration file for customizing theme, plugins, and variants
- Leverage the theme() function in CSS for accessing Tailwind theme values
- Implement dark mode with the dark: variant
- Use responsive variants (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) for adaptive designs
- Leverage state variants (hover:, focus:, active:, etc.) for interactive elements
