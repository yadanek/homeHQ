# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - HomeHQ (Lean MVP)

## 1. Product Overview (v1.0 - Ultra-Lean)

HomeHQ is a web-based "command center" for families. The v1.0 focus is strictly on **Logistics Automation**: reducing a parent's mental load by automatically suggesting tasks based on calendar events.

The core hypothesis is that users will find value in an application that "thinks ahead" by suggesting necessary preparations for family events, even without external integrations or complex list management.

## 2. The Core Problem

Parents suffer from **Mental Load**. Entering "Doctor's Appointment" is easy, but remembering to "Prepare medical records" 24 hours before is the hidden cognitive burden. HomeHQ v1.0 automates the transition from _knowing_ about an event to _preparing_ for it.

## 3. Simplified Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Authentication & Family Setup

- **Registration/Login:** Email and password.
   
- **The Family Space:** First user to register creates a "Family Hub" and becomes Admin.
   
- **Simplified Invitations:** Admin generates a code. New users entering this code are joined to the family as "Members."
   
- **Basic Roles:** * **Admin:** Full access.
   
    - **Member:** Access to shared and personal content.
       

### 3.2. Binary Visibility Model

To simplify development, we remove "Specific People" sharing.

1. **Private (Only Me):** Visible only to the creator.
   
2. **Shared (Family):** Visible to everyone in the family hub.
   

### 3.3. Manual Calendar (No Import)

- **Web View:** Monthly and Daily view of events.
   
- **Event Creation:** Title, Date, Time, and a toggle for "Private" or "Shared."
   
- **Participants:** Checkboxes to select who is involved in the event.
   

### 3.4. AI Assistant (Immediate Suggestions)

The engine only analyzes events during **manual creation** in the web form.

**MVP Rules:**

1. **Birthday:** (Keywords: birthday, bday) -> Suggests: "Buy a gift" (7 days before).
   
2. **Health:** (Keywords: doctor, dentist, clinic) -> Suggests: "Prepare medical documents" (1 day before).
   
3. **Outing:** (Keywords: cinema, date, dinner / Participants: Admins only) -> Suggests: "Book a babysitter" (3 days before).
   
4. **Travel:** (Keywords: flight, trip, vacation) -> Suggests: "Pack bags" (2 days before).
   

**Interface:**

- As the user types the title, a small "Suggestion" box appears below the input: _"Detected [Context]. Add task: [Task Name]? [Add Button]"_.
   

### 3.5. Task Module (Simple Tasks)

- **No standalone "Lists":** Users cannot create "Shopping List" or "Home Improvement" folders.
   
- **Task Feed:** A single view showing all tasks (Generated by AI or added manually).
   
- **Status:** Tasks can be marked as "Completed" or deleted.
   
- **Visibility:** Tasks inherit the "Private" or "Shared" status chosen during creation.
   

## 4. Product Boundaries (Out of Scope)

- **NO iCal/Apple/Google Import:** All data is entered manually.
   
- **NO Standalone Lists:** No custom categories/folders for tasks.
   
- **NO "Specific People" Sharing:** Only "Me" or "Everyone."
   
- **NO Notifications:** No emails or push notifications. Users see changes when they log in.
   
- **NO Mobile App:** Browser only.
   

## 5. User Stories

### Overview
- **US-000: Main Dashboard**
    * As a user, I want to see a dashboard with a month view and a right sidebar so that I can instantly check the family schedule and today's task list.
    * Acceptance Criterion: Personal events are highlighted in blue, while family events are highlighted in green.
    * Acceptance Criterion: Clicking on a specific day in the calendar filters the task list in the sidebar to show tasks for that selected date.

### Setup

- **US-001:** As a user, I want to create a family account so my partner and I can share a digital space.
   
- **US-002:** As an Admin, I want to invite my family members via a code so they can see shared events.
   

### Calendar & AI

- **US-003:** As a user, I want to manually add "Dentist appointment" and have the system suggest "Prepare documents" so I don't forget them on the day of the visit.
   
- **US-004:** As a parent, I want to mark a "Surprise Anniversary Dinner" as **Private** so my kids don't see it on the calendar.
   

### Tasks

- **US-005:** As a user, I want to see a list of all pending tasks (both AI-suggested and manual) so I can stay organized.
   
- **US-006:** As a user, I want to check off a task as "Done" so my partner knows it has been handled.

### Secure Access and Authentication
- **US-007:**
Title: Secure Access
Description: As a user, I want to be able to register and log in to the system in a way that ensures the security of my data.
Acceptance Criteria:
- Login and registration take place on dedicated pages.
- Logging in requires providing an email address and a password.
- Registration requires providing an email address, a password, and password confirmation.
- A non‑logged‑in user sees a page with a short description of what the application does and a suggestion to log in or create an account.
- The user must be logged in to create events and tasks, as well as to read data in the calendar.
- The user can log in to the system using a button in the top‑right corner of the @Dashboard.
- The user can log out of the system using a button in the top‑right corner of the main @Dashboard.
- External login services (e.g., Google, GitHub) are not used.
- Password recovery should be possible.
   

## 6. Success Metrics (Minimal)

1. **Suggestion Conversion:** What percentage of AI suggestions are actually "Added" to the task list? (Target: >50%).
   
2. **Daily Active Users (DAU):** Do users log in more than twice a week to check their status?
   
3. **Task Completion:** Are the AI-generated tasks actually being checked off.
